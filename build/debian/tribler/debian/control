Description: Python based Bittorrent/Internet TV application
 Through our own dedicated Tor-like network for torrent downloading you can
 search and download torrents with less worries or censorship. We are trying
 to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.
 .
 Do not put yourself in danger. Our anonymity is not yet mature. Tribler does
 not protect you against spooks and government agencies. We are a torrent
 client and aim to protect you against lawyer-based attacks and censorship. 
 With help from many volunteers we are continuously evolving and improving.
