 Towards making Bittorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.

Tribler aims to give anonymous access to content. We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography, and authentication the Internet norm.

We implemented `our own enhanced Tor-like network for anonymous torrent downloading <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications>`_, with hidden services based
seeding and end-to-end encryption.

Since 2004, we have been working to ensure that "the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down" (but a single software bug could end everything).
